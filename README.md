#FastWay Application
As some members of the university have a tight schedule, they donâ€™t have time to wait in the queue, our application helps them by providing delivery service within the university. And provide a part-time job for the one who has free time. The user can request things to be delivered to him/her or to send things to other places, the places such as a library, office, pharmacy, and shop. So, our application will display a list of requests for the courier, he/she can choose the request and set the delivery price.
The goal of FastWay application is to make the user more convenient. We hope our application reaches the value we aspire to add. 

The user of the system will be Member: the one who requests orders .
Courier: the one who delivers the order.
